# Generate Parentheses with Rust and CLion

I use this repo with different solutions to [Leetcode's Problem #22](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)
in Rust to demonstrate how various CLion features can help with the development process. 

## Main features

- Using command-line arguments with `clap`
- Benchmarking code with `criterion`
- Testing
- Profiling
- Exploring memory usage
- Using Instruments (macOS) and Valgrind (Linux)
- Integrating with Docker
